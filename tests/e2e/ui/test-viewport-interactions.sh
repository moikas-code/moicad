echo "🎯 Testing Instructions:"
echo "1. Open http://localhost:3002"
echo "2. Try 'cube(10); sphere(5);' in the editor"
echo "3. Test View menu options:"
echo "   - Toggle Grid (should show/hide grid)"
echo "   - Toggle Edges (should show black wireframe)"
echo "   - Try different camera presets (1,7,3,4,5,0)"
echo "   - Switch between Perspective/Orthographic"
echo "   - Use Zoom In/Out and View All"
echo "4. Check that badges update to show active state"

echo "💡 Pro Tips:"
echo "- All view controls are accessible via menu or keyboard shortcuts"
echo "- State is saved automatically and restored on page reload"
echo "- Stats overlay can be toggled independently of other overlays"
echo "- Scale markers show colored X(red), Y(green), Z(blue) axes"
echo "- Crosshair helps with centering and alignment"
echo "- Projection mode switch affects camera but not geometry rendering"
